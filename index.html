        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>We are three artists who host pop-up events regularly. The next pop up event is <b>Sunday,
        October 15th, 2023</b>. Sign up coming soon. Walk-ins always welcome! If you
        don't want any services (or aren't yet sure if you do), feel free to
        drop by anyway and just hang out.
        </p>
        <p>
        <b>Core Values</b>
        <ul>
          <li>explicitly trans and queer friendly</li>
          <li>sliding scale payment/barter (arranged ahead of time)</li>
          <li>community and self-empowerment</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>If you would like one or several of our services available at your
        event, please reach out! If you would like an individual service, we
        do make house calls (within the confines of our "day" "jobs")
        - please reach out, though we can't guarantee anything.
        While One Stop Shop operates in Albuquerque (for the forseeable
        future), and Abdulmajeed and September live in the surrounding area,
        Jess resides in Philly ~75% of the year.
